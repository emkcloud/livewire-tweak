# livewire-tweak

**Custom tweaks for Livewire and Flux**  

Blade directives, script output, and internal behavior have been adjusted. Custom prefixes were added to the default assets generated by official packages to ensure proper use in load-balanced environments.

**Why this package exists**

I built this package based on my experience working with clients who use firewalls and traffic load balancers that rely on custom URL prefixes such as /admin, /backend, /customers, etc. 

In these environments, using popular Laravel packages like Nova, Livewire, or others can be problematic, because they often rely on absolute paths for assets and internal API calls.
