# livewire-tweak

**Custom tweaks for Livewire and Flux**  

Blade directives, script output, and internal behavior have been adjusted. Custom prefixes were added to the default assets generated by official packages to ensure proper use in load-balanced environments.

**Why this package exists**

I built this package based on my experience working with clients who use firewalls and traffic load balancers that rely on custom URL prefixes such as /admin, /backend, /customers, etc. 

In these environments, using popular Laravel packages like Nova, Livewire, or others can be problematic, because they often rely on absolute paths for assets and internal API calls.  

I've raised this issue multiple times, but for reasons unknown to me, it seems there's little interest in officially supporting this kind of feature. So I decided to build a solution for myself and now I'm sharing it with others who might be facing the same problem.
